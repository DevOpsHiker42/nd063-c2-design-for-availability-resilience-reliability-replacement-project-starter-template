Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
================================================================

Architecture
------------
- Databases are MySQL
- Primary Region has a master DB instance and a standby DB instance in a different AZ.
  This provides high availability and data redundancy, but the standby DB instance doesn't support connections for read workloads.
- Secondary Region has a read replica, again with a master DB instance and a standby DB instance in a different AZ.

Assumptions
-----------
- Infrastructure is actively monitored 24x7.
- Remote technical support is available 24x7.
- Established playbooks are in place for incident management.
- The infrastructure is tightly version-controlled using Infrastructure-as-Code with monitoring in place for configuration drift
- Security logging is in place.

Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)
-------------------------------
1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage - 30 minutes

   - Illustrative Timeline:
     00:00 - Outage occurs.
     00:05 - Elapsed time until an alert triggers (5 minutes).
     00:20 - On-call staff respond to alert and log on remotely (15 minutes).
     00:30 - On-call staff start diagnosing issue.
             Root cause is discovered to be the AZ outage.
             RDS is found to have already recovered the database by automatically failing over to the standby instance.
             The immediate incident resolution is complete.
             (10 minutes).

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage - 60 minutes

   - For a region outage, manual failover is required.
   - Assuming the failure is in the Primary Region, the read replica in the Secondary Region must be promoted to be the new master.
   - Network traffic will need to be re-routed to the new endpoint in the Secondary Region.

   - Illustrative Timeline:
     00:00 - Outage occurs.
     00:05 - Elapsed time until an alert triggers (5 minutes).
     00:20 - On-call staff respond to alert and log on remotely (15 minutes).
     00:30 - On-call staff start diagnosing issue (10 minutes).
     00:40 - Root cause is discovered to be the region outage (10 minutes).
     00:45 - Remediation started (5 minutes).
     01:00 - Remediation completed following runbook:
             - Promoted read replica to be the new master.
             - Re-route traffic.
             (15 minutes).


Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs)
--------------------------------
1. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage - 10 minutes

   - Fail over is handled automatically by RDS in a few minutes.
   - As the read replica and master database were synchronized before the outage, the data loss is very small.
   - Data loss is assumed to be a few (<10) minutes until RDS recovery completes.

2. Minimum RPO for a single region outage - 70 minutes

   - Recovery requires manual failover by promoting the read replica to be the new master.
   - RPO is the sum of the manual recovery time (i.e. RTO) and any addition data loss caused by Replica Lag.
   - Replica Lag is the amount of time that the replica is behind the source database.
   - Adding 10 minutes for Replica Lag to the RTO time of 60 minutes gives an RPO of 70 minutes.









Definitions
-----------
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - time that the application can be down for a given incident.
Recover Point Objective (RPO) - how much time for which data can be lost.
